## 🌿 What is Grevia Focus?

**Grevia Focus** is a productivity app that transforms your focus sessions into the growth of beautiful virtual trees. Every time you complete a Pomodoro-style session, your tree grows. When your tree is fully grown, we plant a real tree for you! 🌍

## 🌳 How It Works

1. **Sign Up / Log In**  
   Create your account or log in securely.

2. **Set Your Focus Preferences**  
   Choose your session duration and favorite tree type.

3. **Start a Focus Session**  
   Begin a Pomodoro timer. Stay focused—pausing or leaving the app pauses your tree's growth.

4. **Grow Your Tree**  
   Each completed session grows your virtual tree. Missed sessions slow its growth.

5. **Complete & Plant**  
   When your tree is fully grown, we plant a real tree for you and start a new one!

6. **Track Your Progress**  
   View your stats, streaks, and achievements in the Stats tab.

7. **Customize Your Experience**  
   Change backgrounds, manage notifications, and edit your profile in Settings.
